## Assumptions:

- As a game consulting firm, analyze data from the gaming industry to help your client in
identifying the most bankable game genre, style, gaming platform.
- We assume that we have access to a subset of raw data for the gaming industry.
- Our datasets are taking a subset of what the actual game votes and sales might be,
however the proportion indicates how popular or not a game is based on this subset.
- Our current set of data lists/classifies multiple such games, consoles and publishers that
have been discontinued. For now, we assume that all the listed classes are relevant to our
model. However, we plan to prune our dataset to make it more relevant to todayâ€™s market.
- We assume that attributes related to game playtime are an average of the time that players
take to finish a particular game in main story mode or story mode with extras.
Essentially, we intend to use the metric as a standard time required to finish a game.
- We will be using our source datasets to create datasets as per our dimensional models.
- We assume that the sample used to get the review scores and measure the playtime of a
game is representative of all its player base.
